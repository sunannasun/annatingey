Celebrating one year with our favorite little girl! I will admit that I went a little over the top for Lulu’s birthday party. Your first child only has her first birthday once right? If I’m being completely honest though, this party was just as much for me as it was for her. 

I’m the one who’s survived a whole year of this mothering thing after all! I have been thinking about and envisioning this glorious day since she was just a couple months old. Thinking is the key word here though, as I didn’t actually start planning the party until a mere two and a half weeks before her birthday. Procrastination is one of my toxic traits. Our whole family also got covid around this time which really put a damper on everything as we were just in survival mode, but it actually ended up being kind of a blessing because I really needed the down time and sick days off to finally pull it all together at the last minute. I’m so happy with how everything turned out! 

The Decor
The very first thing I booked when starting to plan Lulu’s party was this white castle bounce house. I had seen it on a friend’s instagram for her daughter’s 2nd birthday party months ago and I instantly knew that Lulu needed one at her party too! Little did I know that they also had a MINI bounce house (with a BALL PIT)! Of course, I booked both. The company is called Mi Casa Su Casa and they were so nice and so great to work with. They came and set both bounce houses up before the party and took them down afterwards. 

Table
Confession. The deciding factor for the entire theme and color scheme of Lulu’s party was inspired by… a tablecloth. I’m not even joking. I originally had a completely different concept in mind when I set out on this endeavor, and I completely scrapped the whole thing a week before the party when I saw this Autumn Chintz Tablecloth from Mrs. Alice. They do the most beautiful tablescapes. Anyway, never in a million years did I ever think that the colors for my baby’s first birthday party would be coral and peach. I don’t even like coral! It reminds me of salmon (which is delicious, but not as a color). But when I saw this tablecloth and how they styled it on the website, I literally felt my heart start beating faster because it was the most gorgeous and perfect mixture of my two favorite things ever: fall and florals. I also purchased the decorative velvet pumpkins and mushrooms in their Autumn collection, which look amazing in person! It would have been quite an extravagant purchase for a one time thing, but I know I will cherish these pieces for many years and parties to come, and look forward to adding them to my thanksgiving table!

Pro tip: instead of buying tablecloths, just get a bolt of fabric from Walmart. This is what I did for the tables that the guests actually sat at. Tablecloths are expensive and it’s hard to find the exact color you want. I was almost in tears whilst facing the abysmal selection at my local Walmart, forced to choose between plain white or cartooney PVC table coverings (can they even be considered cloths?) I was about to give up entirely when I had a stroke of brilliance as I passed the craft section and saw all the pretty bolts of fabric on the shelf. I found the most perfect blush pink 100% cotton fabric. 

Balloons
As someone who has neither the patience nor skill to pull off a beautiful balloon garland, I highly recommend hiring a professional to help with all your balloon needs. I worked with PumpnPop to decorate the dessert table and the mini bounce house and WOW was it worth it! They did an incredible job. 

The Food
Food is THE most important part of any party in my opinion (besides the people there to eat it of course). I wanted the food at Lulu’s party to be delicious but also fun! To me, that meant getting a food truck. Whatever the question, pizza is always the right answer. Enter the PIZZA BUS, the cutest wood fired pizza oven on wheels you’ve ever seen! I booked them through the Food Truck League which was so simple and painless. 

Trader Joe’s was the real MVP of this party. They provided most of the food aside from the pizza and cakes. I made several large charcuterie boards and dispersed  them along the tables. It looked so cute and was basically fool proof. 

Desserts
For Lulu’s smash cake I got a simple 6 inch vanilla cake from Sweet Tooth Fairy. This beloved bake shop has  provided cakes for many a family party in the past so I knew it was a safe choice! Honestly, it was one of the best vanilla cakes I have ever had. On top of Lulu’s cake, I also ordered 4 dozen of their famous cupcakes. Sweet Tooth Fairy is a local legend for being the first Utah company to win the Food Network’s Cupcake Wars a few years ago. 

I also got a 13” crepe cake from Doki Desserts. They are a local Japanese dessert company with the cutest instagram page. This was actually my first time trying one of their crepe cakes (I got the raspberry white chocolate) and it did not disappoint!

One of my secret weapons for making any dessert table instantly cuter is adding a bowl of Trader Joe’s macarons (found in the freezer section). They’re 5.49 a dozen and no one could even tell that they weren’t from a fancy boutique bakery!
